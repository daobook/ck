"MLPerf is a community effort to develop a common Machine Learning (ML) "
"benchmark that provides consistent, reproducible, and fair measurements "
"of accuracy, speed, and efficiency across diverse ML models, datasets, "
"hardware, and software. While MLPerf popularity is steadily growing, the "
"barrier of entry to MLPerf remains high due to a complex benchmarking and"
" submission pipeline and rapidly evolving hardware and software stacks. "
"In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how Apache TVM and the Collective "
"Knowledge framework (CK) can simplify and automate MLPerf inference "
"benchmarking based on our own MLPerf v1.1 submission. The goal is to "
"explain how our flexible open-source stack can lower the barrier of entry"
" for future hardware participants by providing a powerful framework that "
"is both hardware and ML framework agnostic and can optimize almost any "
"deep learning model on almost any deployment hardware."
