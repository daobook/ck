"Hi, I am trying to reproduce the resnet50 benchmark result shows on "
"mlperf.org (edged/closed division row 4). Currently I can achieve 2.4ms "
"latency on Jetson Xavier AGX SingleStream scenario . However, I use "
"trtexec to generate the int8 engine file from resnet50_v1.onnx and "
"trtexec does not support calibration (it uses random weight instead). "
"Could you tell me how did you convert resnet50_v1.onnx to int8 engine "
"file (or plan file) you use in this this repo?"

"To obtain the TensorRT plans, we followed NVIDIA's instructions from "
"their MLPerfâ„¢ Inference v0.5 submission. This happened between the v0.5 "
"and v0.7 submission rounds, i.e. between October 2019 - September 2020. "
"we submitted the results to v0.7 (without DLA support)."
